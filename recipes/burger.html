    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> A burger is a popular sandwich consisting of a grilled or fried ground meat patty, typically beef, served between two slices of a soft bun, often accompanied by various toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and condiments like ketchup and mustard, creating a satisfying handheld meal.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Beef Patty</li>
        <li> Bun</li>
        <li>Toppings</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Ingredients:

            <li> Cook the Burger:
                Grill or pan-fry the beef patties over medium-high heat until they reach your desired level of doneness, typically about 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare.
                If adding cheese, place a slice on each patty a minute before removing them from the heat to allow it to melt.</li>
                <li> Assemble the Burger:
                    Place the cooked patty on the bottom half of the toasted bun.

                    Top with the other half of the bun and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious homemade burger!</li>
