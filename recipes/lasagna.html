<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pasta sheets </li>
    <li>Tomato sauce </li>
    <li>Cheese </li>
</ul>
<h2> Steps </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Components:
        Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente.
        Prepare the tomato sauce, either homemade or store-bought, and any meat or vegetable fillings you plan to use.
        If using ricotta cheese, mix it with beaten eggs and seasonings for added flavor.</li>
        <li>Layer the Ingredients:
            Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of a baking dish to prevent sticking.
            Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.
            Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the noodles, followed by a layer of cheese (such as ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and any other fillings.
            Repeat the layers of noodles, sauce, cheese, and fillings until you reach the top of the dish, finishing with a layer of sauce and cheese on top.</li>
            <li> Bake the Lasagna:
                Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 30-40 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
                Remove the foil during the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the cheese to brown slightly.
                Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
