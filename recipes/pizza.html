<h2>Steps</h2>

    <li> Prepare the Dough and Sauce:
        Make or buy pizza dough and allow it to rise according to the recipe or package instructions.
        Prepare the tomato sauce by cooking down tomatoes with garlic, herbs, and seasoning until thickened.</li>
        <li> Assemble the Pizza:
            Roll out the dough into a round shape and transfer it onto a pizza stone or baking sheet.
            Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
            Sprinkle shredded cheese over the sauce and add desired toppings such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, or olives.</li>

                Carefully transfer the assembled pizza into the preheated oven and bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
